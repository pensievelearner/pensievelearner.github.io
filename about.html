                    <h4 class= "text-white">My primary goal is to be able to help you resolve some of the obstacles that prevent you from reaching your
                        educational goals. I credit a lot of my learning to some excellent tutors that I worked with. My hope is that you will feel
                        more confident in your ability to work .
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        I have spent 8 years tutoring students primarily in programming, mathematics and physics. Throughout this time, I have honed
                        my craft to be able to better customize my lessons to help you succeed. I strive to ensure
                         that you are able to learn in a judgement-free zone. 
                         <br>
                         <br>          
                        While I focus my tutoring on programming, I am also open to potentially teaching mathematics and physics depending on the needs of the student.

                        as well as the data analysis portion. I think I could probably go back to my R material. -->
